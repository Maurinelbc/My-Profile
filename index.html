       <p>
         I'm studying at IESEG School of Management because I really like mathematics and economics... I play volleyball and handball several times a week because I like team sports !! Besides that, traveling and eating well are things that I enjoy a lot. :)

       <h2>Sport</h2>
       <p>
         Passionate about sports since I was young, I love to spend myself intelligently in a club, association or group by practicing team sports such as volleyball, basketball or handball. Indeed, interpersonal skills are one of my main strengths: I am part of a "Generation 2024" ambassador class which allowed me to participate as a volunteer in the Olympic Swimming Games this summer 2024. Just like my participation in many sports competitions, being a volunteer at the Paris 2024 Games allowed me to meet great people from all over the world !!

       <h2>Trips</h2>
       <p>
         As a fan of discovering new things, I really like to travel... In Italy, Mexico, Croatia, Spain or even England, the cultures and stories are all different, just like the food, the monuments or the people. I find it very interesting to discover all these aspects of a country, it allows a cultural opening, but also and above all it guarantees great moments spent with family, alone or with friends!

       <h2>Food</h2>
       <p>
         Even though cooking is not one of my greatest skills, I  love eating refined and beautiful dishes. Indeed, with my friends but especially with my family, I like to try different addresses and restaurants to discover new recipes, new ways of cooking !
